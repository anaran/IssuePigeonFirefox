![Issue Pigeon Logo](icon48.png)

The Issue Pigeon Firefox Add-on knows how to find the home for issues
and bugs you may find in some well-known projects websites.

It will pre-fill bugreports or issue forms with text and feature any
referenced links based on text selections you make prior to clicking
the `Issue Pigeon` icon menu entry.

## Usage

Basic usage is described above.

Furthermore you can specify your own additional project definitions
based on existing reporting methods defined at
[known-origins.js](https://github.com/anaran/IssuePigeonFirefox/blob/master/IssuePigeon/data/known-origins.js)

Use the `Settings` icon menu entry to specify and save
your own JSON declarations. Declarations will be verified with
`JSON.parse` prior to saving.

A Help link is also provided, pointing to this user documentation.

## Feedback

You will be given the opportunity to open github issues (via clickable
notifications) when `Issue Pigeon` cannot find a way to report your
issue or detects other problems.
