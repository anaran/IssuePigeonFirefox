# README for Developers

This README is not delivered with the add-on. It is aimed at
developers and contributors.

## Add-on User Help

[IssuePigeon/data/HELP.md](IssuePigeon/data/HELP.md) is what gets converted to HTML and bundled with the add-on, accessible under the `Help` menu entry.

## Issues

See [Issues Â·
anaran/IssuePigeonFirefox](https://github.com/anaran/IssuePigeonFirefox/issues).

Some of these may be created directly by add-on users when they click
the error notifications provided by the add-on.

## Contributing

Please follow the same rules as described in
[contributing.md](https://github.com/anaran/LastScrollChrome/blob/master/contributing.md)
for another project of mine.
